I am a fourth year PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://ph.ucla.edu/departments/biostatistics) at UCLA. Prior to this, I completed Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s in Statistics from the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/) in 2019 and 2021 respectively. At UCLA Biostatistics, I am working with [Prof. Sudipto Banerjee](http://sudipto.bol.ucla.edu/) on [Bayesian modeling of dynamical systems](https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxae061) and development of [Bayesian predictive stacking for analysis of geospatial data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04655). My research interests surrounds development of new and exciting Bayesian methodology for analysing complex dependent data and deliver fully model-based probabilistic uncertainty quantification. For the past few years, I have also grown a keen interest in the computational aspects inherent in statistical inference, especially within the Bayesian paradigm.
