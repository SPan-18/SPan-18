Hi, I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://ph.ucla.edu/departments/biostatistics) at UCLA. Prior to this, I completed Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s in Statistics from the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/) in 2019 and 2021 respectively. At UCLA Biostatistics, I am working with [Prof. Sudipto Banerjee](http://sudipto.bol.ucla.edu/) on [Bayesian modelling of dynamical systems](https://github.com/SPan-18/RailcarExposureModelling) and development of Bayesian predictive stacking for conjugate distributions from the natural exponential family. My previous works include statistical modelling of complex multi-layered relational data and distribution-free correlation-based tests. Besides my current research, I am currently learning about Bayesian nonparametric modelling as I am interested in development of suitable methodologies for modelling mechanistic systems.
